description: Answer organization-level questions about Everruns. How much was spent and on what, token and tool usage by agent or model, what is broken (health issues, failing turns), who changed what (change history, audit log), and budgets. Use when the user asks about usage, cost, reliability or recent changes across agents rather than about one session. Builds on the everruns skill.

# Operate an Everruns organization

Everything here is read-only unless the user asks for a change, so run it with
MCP `query` or the CLI. Commands are the `everruns` command language (see the
`everruns` skill); check flags with `--help`.

Start broad with a report, then drill into the agents and sessions it points at.

## Usage and spend: reports

```bash
everruns reports catalog get          # datasets, dimensions, measures, filters
everruns reports query run --help     # one query: dataset, measures, dimensions, filters, time range
```

The catalog is the source of truth; read it before writing a query. The
datasets today:

| Dataset | Answers |
|---|---|
| `llm_generations` | Tokens, latency, time to first token, errors by model, provider, agent or day |
| `tool_calls` | Which tools run, how often, and how often they fail |
| `turns`, `sessions` | Volume and outcomes of agent work |
| `budget_postings` | Money: debits and credits against budgets |
| `capability_usage` | Which capabilities are actually used |

Group by `agent_name` or `model` and by `day` for trends. Saved reports
(`everruns reports saved list`) are ones the organization already relies on:
check them before building a new query.

Report numbers with their time range and units, and say which dataset they
came from.

## Budgets

```bash
everruns budgets list --help          # limits per session, agent, user or organization
everruns budgets ledger list --help   # what was charged and when
```

Creating a budget, changing a limit or topping up spends or restricts money:
confirm the subject, amount and currency with the user first, then use
`execute` with `--reason`.

## What is broken

1. `everruns health-issues list`: problems Everruns already detected (provider
   credentials, failing integrations). `everruns health-issues get <id>` explains one.
2. Failing work: query `turns` or `llm_generations` grouped by `agent_name` for
   errors over the last day, then open a failing session
   (`everruns-debug-session`).
3. Per-agent checks: `everruns agents health-checks list --help`.

## Who changed what

- `everruns history org --help`: every recorded change across the
  organization, newest first, with the reason given.
- `everruns history list <id>` and `everruns history diff --help` for one entity.
- `everruns orgs audit-logs list --help`: sign-ins, membership and other
  security events.

When a behavior change lines up with a recorded change, say so with both
timestamps. Rolling back (`history restore`) is a change: ask first.

## Models and providers

- `everruns models list`, and the organization default model.
- `everruns providers list --help`: which model providers are configured.
  Provider keys are entered by the user on the **Providers** page, never through you.

## Reporting back

Lead with the answer (a number, a list of broken things, the change that
explains it), then the evidence: the query or command, the time range, and
links to the agents and sessions involved.
